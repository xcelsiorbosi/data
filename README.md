# uniEx4
Made for uni excercise 4 visualisation course

purpose: Implement visual with transition property

Briefly describe the data source you have used and comment on any conclusions that can be
drawn from your visualisation. 

Data Source: 
I posted the dat onto git and used an api call to the json file. (internet connection required to use this diagram)
The Data Source used was a rolled up version of fatalities data of mass shootings that I am using for this same course. 
The Data was aggregated to a yearly grain as to display total fatalities per year as a result of mass shootings. 

Conclusions:
The end result was a bar chart with transition properties. 
This did enhance the graphic as the bar chart that converts into a vertical tree map allowing the user to see trends of the max fatalities over yearly periods until there is a greater value. 

This assisted from truning a relatively plain graphic into a graphic that displays both trends by yearly duration of larger attacks growing in size but also the frequency of attacks is closer together which is easy to derive from the transition function that slides to a close.
